## Wrap up!

1. Brands require  social media executives like you, to manage **official accounts** and serve their customers through WeChat

2. **Mini Programs** are a great extension of your account for fast sales, great service, added-value content. **You got an idea?** The best way to get started is looking at the market, browsing stores and writing down a **scope of work**.

3. Before jumping RIGHT into code, you want to **design mockups yourself** and show it around for feedbacks. Use Sketch, Figma or any **prototyping tool**. Iterate.

4. HTML is the markup language to structure a page. **WXML** is its (smarter) equivalent in the **WeChat world**. They work with CSS for design.

5. **Javascript** is a powerful language to play with data and animate your web-pages. Tencent gives us tons of **Application Programming Interface** in Javascript to animate Mini Programs.

6. The WeChat MP framework is built upon a binding of **WXML <> JS**. They always work together:

- WXML is the **view layer**, to display stuff.
- JS is the **logical layer**, to fetch data from outside (HTTP) and update the view.
